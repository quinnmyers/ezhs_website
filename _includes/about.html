    <p>EZ Home Staging has a simple goal. We want to help you sell your home faster and for more money. Whether you need a single room staged or your entire home, we are here to help. EZ Home Staging offers a tiered pricing model; however, there is no initial
      charge or risk to you for the first three months. If you choose to work with us and your home doesnâ€™t sell in three months, we will pick up our furniture and accesories and give you an invoice for exactly $0, yes, ZERO dollars. You only pay us if
      your home sells. </p>
