EZ Home Staging offers a tiered pricing model; however, there is no initial charge or risk to you beyond a set-up fee ranging from $299-$599 for the first three months. If you choose to work with us and your home doesnâ€™t sell in three months, we will pick up our furniture and accessories, giving you an invoice for $0, you only pay us the initial set-up fee.</p></div></section>
